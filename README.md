#QBasic Kurve

## What is QBasic Kurve?
A remake of [Achtung, die Kurve!](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Achtung,_die_Kurve!), a classical DOS game originally written in Borland C++. I want to create something similar to that in QBasic.

## How can I run this?
You need a `QBasic` interpreter, I recommend Microsofts `Quickbasic` (Windows only, probably not compatible with Win7) as it is the one I am programming and testing with. You can get the IDE with an interpreter only, or also with an compiler (German download site: [qbasic.de](http://www.antonis.de/qbdown/qbcompil.htm)). There are other interpreters/compilersike [QB64](http://www.qb64.net/) or [FreeBasic](http://www.freebasic.net/), but I haven't tested it with that.

Would not be possible without:

* Eric Carr with his inline assambly multi-key input routine (taken from [here](http://tek-tips.com/faqs.cfm?fid=4193))
* The Thech iWarehouse with it's timing function (taken from [here](www.techiwarehouse.com/cat/17/BASIC-Programming))
* The keycode table by nightcode ([here](http://www.angelfire.com/scifi/nightcode/prglang/qbasic/function/devices/keyboard_scan_codes.html))
